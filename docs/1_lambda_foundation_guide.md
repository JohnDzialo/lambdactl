**Performance Optimization**:
- Keep data in faster memory when possible
- Minimize data movement between memory levels
- Use memory coalescing for efficient access patterns

### 5.3 Common AI Workload Patterns

#### Training vs Inference

**Training**:
- Forward pass: compute predictions
- Loss calculation: compare with ground truth
- Backward pass: compute gradients
- Parameter update: adjust model weights
- **Memory intensive**: stores activations and gradients
- **Compute intensive**: lots of matrix operations

**Inference**:
- Forward pass only
- Lower memory requirements
- Optimized for latency or throughput
- Often uses reduced precision (FP16, INT8)

#### Distributed Training Patterns

**Data Parallel**:
```
Model replicated across GPUs:
GPU 1: [Model Copy] → processes batch 1-32
GPU 2: [Model Copy] → processes batch 33-64
GPU 3: [Model Copy] → processes batch 65-96
GPU 4: [Model Copy] → processes batch 97-128
↓
Gradients synchronized across all GPUs
```

**Model Parallel**:
```
Model split across GPUs:
GPU 1: [Layers 1-5]  →
GPU 2: [Layers 6-10] →
GPU 3: [Layers 11-15] →
GPU 4: [Layers 16-20]
↓
Sequential processing through pipeline
```
